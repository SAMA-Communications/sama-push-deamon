# SAMA Push Notifications service

## Overview

A web service for Push Notifications.

Currently, only Web pushes are supported.

## Development

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- generate VAPID keys via `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys` and set Public Key to `PUBLIC_VAPID_KEY` and Private Key to `PRIVATE_VAPID_KEY` inÂ `.env` file. The Public Key value should be the same to what is used in **sama-client**
- set your Firebase app name in `FCM_APP_NAME` env and Apple keys in `APN_KEY_ID`, `APN_TEAM_ID` envs. Also provide `APN_IS_PRODUCTION` env.
- put the key files to the `.certs` folder, rename the files to `firebase-sama-project-key.json` and `apns-sama-project-key.json`
- make sure that `SAMA_PUSH_QUEUE_NAME` matches the variable `SAMA_NATIVE_PUSH_QUEUE_NAME` located in `.env` of your server
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run start`
